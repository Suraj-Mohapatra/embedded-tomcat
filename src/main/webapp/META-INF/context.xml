<Context path="/app"/>

<!--
1) Modern versions of Tomcat discourage setting the context path in /webapp/META-INF/context.xml.
2) The context path can also be configured via the Cargo plugin in the pom.xml.
3) If neither of the above is specified, Tomcat will use the WAR file name as the context path.
The order of precedence is: 1 > 2 > 3.
